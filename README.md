# Bonus Assignment: **Data Analysis and Interpretation**

## **Context**

Understanding market dynamics and the factors influencing property prices is crucial. This task simulates a real-world scenario where you'll derive insights from property sales data, focusing on developer performance and project success.

## **Task**

You are provided with CSV files containing data on residential property sales and available units. The data includes ID, Project Name, Developer Name, Number of Units Sold, Price, and various attributes of the properties.

[market-units-raw-sales-anonymized.csv](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/39316dd9-767c-4571-8f5a-518a2785fe7a/af64ce17-5f9c-4940-b094-7d668df3901d/market-units-raw-sales-anonymized.csv)

Your objectives are:

1. **Data Cleaning and Structuring:**
    - Write a script in Python to load, clean, and structure the data from the CSV file. Address any missing or inconsistent data points and ensure the data is in a usable format for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis:**
    - Determine the developer who sold the most units overall and provide a summary of their sales performance.
    - Identify the top 5 projects with the highest number of units sold.
    - Feel free to come up with additional interesting metrics.
3. **Data Visualization:**
    - Create a visualization that shows the distribution of properties by the number of rooms (layout).
    - Display the sales performance of the top 5 projects identified in your analysis.
    - Feel free to come up with additional interesting charts.
4. **Statistical Analysis (not mandatory):**
    - Conduct a linear regression analysis to determine which factors most significantly impact the price of properties. Consider various property attributes (like floor area or exterior area) in your model.

## **Submission**

- Submit a Python script (.py file) or a Jupyter notebook that includes your data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and statistical analysis processes.
- Ensure your script is well-commented to clearly explain your methods and reasoning.

## **Resources**

- Feel free to use any Python library that you find suitable for accomplishing the tasks.

This task is intended to evaluate your analytical skills, ability to extract actionable insights from data, and proficiency in communicating your findings, reflecting the critical thinking required for a data engineer.
